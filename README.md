# Instacart grocery basket analysis
In this course project I used python pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to summarise, clean, wrangle and analyse data sets of 34+ million rows for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. 

Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. So I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 

The data sets contain information on orders, products and customers. 

In the folders you can find my code for: wrangling & subsetting, data consistency checks, combining & exporting data, deriving new variables, grouping data & aggregating variables and data visualisation in Python. 

The folder called customer data wrangling, consistency checks & merge is a copy of the original where I removed all PII. 

In this project, I answered questions such as: 

- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Are there particular times of the day where customers spend most money?
- Are certain types of products more popular?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences based on region?
- What are the demographics of customers? Are there differences in behaviour?
